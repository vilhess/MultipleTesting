# Distribution-Free multiple testing

This repository delves into the exploration of distribution-free multiple testing, inspired by the paper "[Distribution-Free multiple testing](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/electronic-journal-of-statistics/volume-11/issue-1/Distribution-free-multiple-testing/10.1214/17-EJS1277.full)".

Here, we present implementations of two pivotal multiple testing procedures: the Benjamini-Hochberg method and the Barber and Candès procedure. Through meticulous comparison and analysis, we scrutinize the efficacy and applicability of these methods in accordance with recent research findings.

Accompanying our implementations is a comprehensive report, encapsulating our findings and insights.

For further reference, here are the papers we draw upon:
